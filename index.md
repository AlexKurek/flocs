# Latest containers
{: .fs-9 }

Pre-built containers are available through a webdav hosted by SURF. These are built as generically as possible without compiler optimisations in an attempt to allow them to run on a wide variety of machines. The cost of that is that containers with `generic` and `x86-64` in their name likely run slower than containers optimised for the specific CPU architecture of your machine or cluster.

This page documents my [LOFAR containers]. These containers package a collection of common LOFAR software that is used for imaging science with both Dutch and international array. Pre built containers are publicly available through a webdav hosted on [SURF].
